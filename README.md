# [Project 1: Predictions on the stock market with LSTM networks (neural networks) in Python](https://github.com/NicolasZFr/nvidia_prediction_lstm)
I did this project to make a model based on LSTM networks to make the model handle long-term dependencies in sequential data in order to predict the next prices.  
- The neural network uses the Yahoo Finance pip library and the Nvidia shares
- Can be seen in this [Github repository](https://github.com/NicolasZFr/nvidia_prediction_lstm)
# [Project 2: Automobile business analysis and supervised machine learning algorithms (price prediction)](https://github.com/NicolasZFr/auto-reg-prediction)
This project realized the preprocessing, EDA and evaluates different supervised machine learning models to find the best one to predict the price of the cars
- This model uses the cars datasets of the [University of California Irvine](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data)
- The algorithms used are Xgboost, polinomyal regression, SVM, Voting regressor, decission tree regressor and k-neighbors regressor
- This project is hosted in the linked [Github repository](https://github.com/NicolasZFr/auto-reg-predictio)
