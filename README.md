# [Project 1: Predictions on the stock market with LSTM networks (neural networks) in Python](https://github.com/NicolasZFr/nvidia_prediction_lstm)
This is a project I did to make a model based on LSTM networks to make the model handle long-term dependencies in sequential data in order to predict the next prices.  
- This uses the Yahoo Finance pip library and the Nvidia shares
